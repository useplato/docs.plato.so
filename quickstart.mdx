<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate your API key">
    Head to the [Plato dashboard](https://plato.so/settings) and copy your API key. Keep this secure - you'll need it for all API requests.

    <Warning>
      Your API key provides access to your Plato environments. Never share it publicly or commit it to version control.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Plato CLI">
    Install the Plato CLI for simulator development:

    ```bash
    uv tool install plato-sdk
    ```

    <Tip>
      The CLI requires Python 3.8+ and provides access to all Plato Hub features
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up your environment variables">
    Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your API key:

    ```bash .env
    PLATO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    PLATO_BASE_URL=https://plato.so/api
    ```

    The SDK will automatically load these environment variables.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone your first simulator">
    Let's clone an existing simulator and start developing:

    ```bash
    # See what simulators are available
    plato list-simulators

    # Clone a simulator 
    plato hub clone custom-sim
    cd custom-sim

    # Check the configuration
    cat plato-config.yml
    ```

    This downloads the simulator code and sets up your local development environment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start development sandbox">
    Now let's start a development sandbox to test your changes:

    ```bash
    # Start a development sandbox with live VM
    plato hub sandbox

    # This will:
    # 1. Create a development branch
    # 2. Start a VM with your code
    # 3. Set up SSH tunneling
    # 4. Present interactive menu for development
    ```

    Choose **Option 1** to start simulator services, then **Option 2 or 3** to connect your editor (VS Code or Cursor) directly to the VM.

    <Note>
      The sandbox provides a complete development environment with your code, database, and services running in an isolated VM that you can connect to directly.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Develop and deploy changes">
    Once you've made changes in your sandbox, deploy them to the Plato registry:

    ```bash
    # Make your changes in the connected editor

    # Commit and deploy your changes  
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add new feature"
    plato hub git push
    ```

    Your changes are now deployed and available for use!
  </Step>

## Need Help?

- **CLI installation issues?** Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and try `uv --version` to verify uv is installed
- **Authentication problems?** Double-check your API key and ensure it's properly set in your environment
- **Sandbox won't start?** Verify you're in a directory with `.plato-hub.json` configuration
- **Git operations failing?** Run `uv run plato hub login` to refresh your credentials

<Tip>
  The development sandbox provides live SSH access to your VM. Use VS Code or Cursor's remote SSH features for the best development experience.
