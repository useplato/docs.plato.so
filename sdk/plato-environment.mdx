# Accessing Plato Environment

There are two ways to access and use a Plato environment: using Plato's managed browser (recommended) or setting up your own custom browser.

## Method 1: Using Plato's Managed Browser (Recommended)

<Note>
This is the recommended way to access the environment as it provides seamless integration with Plato's infrastructure and state management.
</Note>

```python
from plato import Plato

# Initialize client
plato = Plato(api_key="your-api-key")

# Initialize the environment
env = await plato.make_environment("doordash")

# Start interaction
await env.reset()
cdp_url = await env.get_cdp_url()

# Connect using CDP
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async with async_playwright() as p:
    browser = await p.chromium.connect_over_cdp(cdp_url)
    page = await browser.new_page()
    # Your automation code here

# Get final state mutations
state_changes = await env.get_state()
```

### State Management
```python
# Get current state
state = await env.get_state()

# Get state mutations
mutations = await env.get_state_mutations()
```

## Method 2: Custom Browser Setup

If you need full control over the browser configuration, you can set up your own browser instance. You can find the complete example in our GitHub repository at [custom_browser_environment.py](https://github.com/useplato/plato-client/blob/main/benchmarker/examples/custom_browser_environment.py).

```python
from plato.sync_sdk import SyncPlato
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

# Initialize client
client = SyncPlato()

# Create environment
env = client.make_environment(
    env_id="doordash",
    interface_type=None,  # Required for custom browser
)

# Initialize environment
env.wait_for_ready()
env.reset()

# Get proxy configuration
proxy_config = env.get_proxy_config()
# Returns:
# {
#     "server": "https://proxy.plato.so",
#     "username": "<env_id>",
#     "password": "<session_id>"
# }

# Launch browser with proxy
with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(
        headless=False,  # Set to True for headless mode
        proxy=proxy_config,
        args=[
            "--ignore-certificate-errors",
            "--ignore-ssl-errors",
            "--disable-http2",
        ],
    )
    
    page = browser.new_page()
    # Your automation code here
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. Environment Not Ready
```python
# Always wait for environment to be ready
await env.wait_for_ready()  # This is required before any operations
```

### 2. Session Not Initialized
```python
# Reset environment to initialize session
await env.reset()  # Required before getting cdp_url
```

### 3. CDP Connection Failed
```python
# Verify CDP URL
cdp_url = await env.get_cdp_url()
print(f"CDP URL: {cdp_url}")
```

## Environment URLs

You can access your environment through several URLs:

```python
# Get live view URL (for monitoring)
live_url = await env.get_live_view_url()

# Get public URL
public_url = await env.get_public_url()

# Get session URL
session_url = await env.get_session_url()
```

## Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
PLATO_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

<Note>
Remember to always close the environment when you're done to free up resources.
