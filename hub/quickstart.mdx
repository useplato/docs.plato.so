# Quickstart Guide

Get up and running with Plato Hub in minutes. Create and deploy your first simulator with just a few commands.

## Your First Simulator

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone a Simulator">
    Clone an existing simulator:

    ```bash
    plato hub clone custom-sim
    cd custom-sim
    ```

    This downloads the simulator code and sets up your local development.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Configuration">
    Create your `plato-config.yml` file:

    ```yaml plato-config.yml
    compute:
      cpus: 1                    # Number of CPU cores for the VM
      memory: 2048               # Memory in MB for the VM
      disk: 10240                # Disk space in MB for the VM
      app_port: 8080             # Port your main application runs on
      plato_messaging_port: 7000 # Port for Plato worker communication

    datasets:
      base:                      # Dataset name - you can have multiple
        entrypoint:
          type: "docker"         # How to start services (only "docker" supported)
          file: "docker-compose.yml"        # Path to your docker compose file
          healthy_wait_timeout: 300         # Seconds to wait for services to start
          required_services: ["*"]          # Services to wait for ("*" = all)
        mutation_listeners:      # Database monitoring configuration
          db:                    # Listener name (can be anything)
            type: "db"           # Type of listener (only "db" supported)
            db_type: "postgresql" # Database type
            db_host: "localhost" # Database host
            db_port: 5432        # Database port
            db_user: "app_user"  # Database user
            db_password: "password"          # Database password
            db_database: "app_db"            # Database name
    ```

    This configuration defines your VM resources and how your simulator runs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    Push your changes to deploy:

    ```bash
    plato hub git push
    ```

    That's it! Your simulator is now deployed and ready to use.
    
    **Your deployed simulator is accessible as:**
    - **Service:** `custom-sim`
    - **Version:** `{git-commit-hash}` (e.g., `a1b2c3d`)
    - **Tag:** `{git-branch-name}` (e.g., `main`, `feature-auth`)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Project Structure

Your simulator project needs just one required file:

```
custom-sim/
  plato-config.yml           # Required: VM and service configuration
  
  # Your app files - organize however you like
  src/
  app/
  config/
  docker-compose.yml
  ...
```

**`plato-config.yml`** - The only required file. Defines your VM resources, datasets, and how services start.

## Configuration Reference

### Compute Section

The `compute` section defines the VM resources for your simulator:

- **`cpus`** (1-8) - Number of CPU cores allocated to the VM
- **`memory`** (512-16384 MB) - RAM allocated to the VM  
- **`disk`** (1024-102400 MB) - Disk space for the VM
- **`app_port`** (1024-65535) - Port your main application listens on
- **`plato_messaging_port`** (1024-65535) - Port for Plato worker communication

### Datasets Section

The `datasets` section defines different environments (base, test, production-copy, etc.):

#### Entrypoint Configuration

- **`type`** - Always "docker" (only supported type)
- **`file`** - Path to your docker-compose.yml file
- **`healthy_wait_timeout`** (30-1800 seconds) - How long to wait for services to start
- **`required_services`** - Array of service names to wait for, or ["*"] for all services

#### Mutation Listeners

Database monitoring configuration for tracking state changes:

- **`type`** - Always "db" (only supported type)
- **`db_type`** - Database type: "postgresql", "mysql", or "sqlite"  
- **`db_host`** - Database hostname or IP
- **`db_port`** - Database port number
- **`db_user`** - Database username
- **`db_password`** - Database password
- **`db_database`** - Database name

### Multiple Datasets Example

```yaml
datasets:
  base:
    entrypoint:
      file: "docker-compose.yml"
      required_services: ["web", "db"]  # Only wait for specific services
    mutation_listeners:
      main-db: { ... }
      
  test-data:
    entrypoint:
      file: "test/docker-compose.yml"
      healthy_wait_timeout: 600  # Longer timeout for test environment
    mutation_listeners:
      test-db: { ... }
```
