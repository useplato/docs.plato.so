# Getting Started Guide

Plato Hub makes it easy to develop and manage simulators. This guide will walk you through cloning your first simulator and setting up a development environment.

## Overview

With Plato Hub, you can:
- **Clone existing simulators** to your local machine
- **Develop in isolated environments** with full Docker support
- **Test changes in real-time** with live reloading
- **Deploy changes** with automatic versioning

## Installation

First, install the Plato SDK for your platform:

```bash
uv init

# macOS Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
uv add plato-sdk==1.0.95.dev20251027235103

# macOS Intel
uv add plato-sdk==1.0.95.dev20251027235111

# Linux AMD64
uv add plato-sdk==1.0.95.dev20251027235232
```

## Your First Simulator

Let's clone and run an existing simulator to see how everything works.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone a Simulator">
    Clone an existing simulator (we'll use `espocrm` as an example):

    ```bash
    uv run plato hub clone espocrm
    ```

    This creates a local directory with the simulator code and sets up git remote configuration.

    You can explore available hub commands:

    ```bash
    uv run plato hub
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Simulator">
    Enter the cloned simulator directory:

    ```bash
    cd espocrm
    ```

    You'll find the simulator's source code, configuration files, and documentation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Configuration">
    Look at the simulator configuration:

    ```bash
    cat plato-config.yml
    ```

    This file defines compute resources, datasets, and entrypoints for the simulator.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Structure

A typical Plato simulator has this structure:

```
espocrm/
├── plato-config.yml          # VM and dataset configuration
├── datasets/
│   └── base/
│       └── docker-compose.yml   # Main application services  
├── src/
│   └── espocrm/
│       └── env.py           # Mutation listeners and environment setup
└── .plato-hub.json          # Hub configuration (auto-generated)
```

## Configuration Structure

The `plato-config.yml` file defines how your simulator runs:

```yaml plato-config.yml
service: espocrm  # Service name for this simulator

datasets:
  base: &base  # YAML anchor for reusing configuration
    compute: &base_compute
      cpus: 1                    # Number of vCPUs allocated to VM
      memory: 3072               # Memory in MB
      disk: 10240                # Disk space in MB
      app_port: 80               # Main application port
      plato_messaging_port: 7000 # Port for Plato worker (keep unless conflicting with an app port)

    services: &base_services
      main_app:                       # Identifier for this service
        type: docker-compose
        file: base/docker-compose.yml

        required_healthy_containers:  # Containers that must be healthy
          - espocrm                   # Container name from docker-compose.yml

    listeners: &base_listeners
      db:                             # Identifier for this listener
        type: db                      # Listener type
        db_type: postgresql           # postgresql, mysql, or sqlite

        db_port: 5432
        db_user: espocrm
        db_password: espocrm
        db_database: espocrm
        volumes:                      # Volume mounts for signal exchange
          - /home/plato/db_signals:/tmp/postgres-signals
          # Format: <vm_path>:<container_path>[:ro|rw]
          # Add more volumes as needed for your application
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have a simulator cloned locally, you can:

- **[Set up a development sandbox](/hub/development-sandbox)** to test your changes
- **[Learn about simulator management](/hub/simulator-management)** commands
- **[Understand the deployment workflow](/hub/deployment-workflow)** for publishing changes

<Tip>
  Each simulator can have multiple datasets (like `base`, `test-data`, `production-copy`) with different configurations and data sets.
