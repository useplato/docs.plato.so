# Quickstart Guide

Plato Hub makes it easy to develop and manage simulators. This guide will walk you through cloning your first simulator and setting up a development environment.

## Overview

With Plato Hub, you can:
- **Clone existing simulators** to your local machine
- **Develop in isolated environments** with full Docker support
- **Test changes in real-time** with live reloading
- **Deploy changes** with automatic versioning

## Your First Simulator

Let's clone and run an existing simulator to see how everything works.

<Steps>
  <Step title="List Available Simulators">
    See what simulators are available:

    ```bash
    uv run plato list-simulators
    ```

    You'll see a table showing all available simulators with their status and descriptions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone a Simulator">
    Clone an existing simulator (we'll use `espocrm` as an example):

    ```bash
    uv run plato hub clone espocrm
    ```

    This creates a local directory with the simulator code and sets up git remote configuration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Simulator">
    Enter the cloned simulator directory:

    ```bash
    cd espocrm
    ```

    You'll find the simulator's source code, configuration files, and documentation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Configuration">
    Look at the simulator configuration:

    ```bash
    cat plato-config.yml
    ```

    This file defines compute resources, datasets, and entrypoints for the simulator.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Structure

A typical Plato simulator has this structure:

```
espocrm/
├── plato-config.yml          # VM and dataset configuration
├── datasets/
│   └── base/
│       └── docker-compose.yml   # Main application services  
├── src/
│   └── espocrm/
│       └── env.py           # Mutation listeners and environment setup
└── .plato-hub.json          # Hub configuration (auto-generated)
```

### Key Files

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="plato-config.yml" icon="gear">
    Defines compute resources, datasets, and how services start up
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="docker-compose.yml" icon="docker">
    Defines your application services (database, web app, etc.)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="env.py" icon="python">
    Configures mutation listeners for tracking database changes
  </Card>
  
  <Card title=".plato-hub.json" icon="link">
    Links your local directory to the remote simulator repository
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Configuration Structure

The `plato-config.yml` file defines how your simulator runs:

```yaml plato-config.yml
compute:
  cpus: 1
  memory: 2048        # MB
  disk: 10240         # MB  
  app_port: 8080
  plato_messaging_port: 7000

datasets:
  base:
    entrypoint:
      type: "docker"
      file: "datasets/base/docker-compose.yml"
      healthy_wait_timeout: 300
      required_services: ["*"]  # Wait for all services
    mutation_listeners:
      container-1:
        type: "db"
        db_type: "postgresql"
        db_host: "localhost"
        db_port: 5432
        db_user: "app_user"
        db_password: "${DB_PASSWORD}"
        db_database: "app_db"
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have a simulator cloned locally, you can:

- **[Set up a development sandbox](/hub/development-sandbox)** to test your changes
- **[Learn about simulator management](/hub/simulator-management)** commands
- **[Understand the deployment workflow](/hub/deployment-workflow)** for publishing changes

<Tip>
  Each simulator can have multiple datasets (like `base`, `test-data`, `production-copy`) with different configurations and data sets.
